CatImage
========

CatImage is an ImageLoader, simple, easy and fast to use. Cache in memory and external SDCARD. Support multiple type of image


There is a lot of diferent kinds of ImageLoader, the difference with CatImage is the type of image that allows and that the cache is done in external storage too.
CatImage allow to load and cache Icons given a package name. From resources and assets aswell.

Still a lot of work to do.
